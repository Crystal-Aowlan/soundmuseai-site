    <h2>About SoundMuseAI</h2>
    <p>
      SoundMuseAI was created by <strong>Crystal Aowlan</strong>, a UK-based independent artist, music explorer, and creative polymath.  
      It was designed as a creative companion — a tool that adapts to your needs and skill level, rather than dictating them.  
      Whether you're a seasoned musician or just beginning your journey, SoundMuseAI offers a safe, encouraging space for all users,  
      including those who are neurodivergent, disabled, or creatively blocked.  
    </p>
    <p>
      This project began as a vision for something better:  
      a musical co-creator that listens, responds, evolves, and supports — without judgement, jargon, or noise.  
      SoundMuseAI aims to empower, inspire, and help users find their voice, one sound at a time.
